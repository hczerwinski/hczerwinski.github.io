    <p>Hello again, as you saw my name is Henry Czerwinski. I major Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island. I can be a little<br>
    out of control outside of class but I am diligent in my studies. I intend to make millions of dollars so this website is the first step<br>
    in doing so. I enjoy playing video games talking with friends and meeting new people. I'm not a party goer but I like to be around the scene<br>
    if that makes any sense. I intend to succeed in school and thank you again for visiting my page.</p>
